changelog=
  v2.3.4 (2024-07-11)
  * Removed support for non-Planet datasets search filters.
  v2.3.3 (2024-04-12)
  * Fixed issue in rendering a streamed basemap saved in a project after user logout.
  * Fixed processing index issue when selecting multiple months or years for basemap exploring.
  v2.3.2 (2024-03-07)
  * Fixed bug when filtering search results for Landsat and Sentinel data.
  v2.3.1 (2023-07-21)
  * Access new "publishing stage" filters for PlanetScope data to see even more available PlanetScope imagery in their areas of interest.
  * Apply a "composite" tool at Order Checkout, which can composite multiple images into a single image for an area of interest or by Satellite Strip.
  * PSOrthoTile Item Types have been deprecated.
  * Fixed bug when accessing Planet xyz tiles in QGIS.
  v2.3.0 (2023-02-09)
  * Fixed the auto-fill coordinates feature for setting a point collect location in QGIS and auto-populating those coordinates to our tasking dashboard.
  * Better multi-polygon search handling. Users can now search in individual polygons in a multi-polygon or by selecting a bounding box around the multi-polygon extent.
  * New "Add to Map" button in the Orders Panel that when selected will automatically render a true color visualization of PlanetScope or SkySat imagery in the QGIS map.
  * Added STAC metadata as an option during Order Checkout so customers can download their images with STAC metadata.
  * Fixed some the metadata fields in our imagery footprints so that they now have the correct data format. Previously, all fields in the footprint's attribute table were strings.
  * Updated a few links in the Add-In to our Developer Trial, Planet University, Planet Community and ToS.
  * Customers can now see a SQKM size estimate when they draw an AOI to search for imagery or  Basemap quads for download.
  * The Basemap series cadence filter is now ordered correctly.
  v2.2.0 (2022-03-01)
  * This update adds a new PlanetScope imagery type (PSScene) that includes new 8-band PlanetScope imagery that is radiometrically aligned with Sentinel-2
  * Users can also find a new option to "harmonize" their PlanetScope Surface Reflectance orders at checkout to improve the radiometric consistency across different PlanetScope sensors
  v2.1.1 (2021-10-01)
  * This patch addresses a number of quality improvements, including a time-stamp discrepancy issue impacting the image search results from the Planet inspector tool, compared to the timestamp on results returned by the image search panel. These time stamps are now consistent and accurate.
  v2.0.1 (2020-05-21)
  * Show acquired date instead of publish date for images
  * Do not show proc options for 8 bit basemaps
  v2.0.0 (2020-01-15)
  * Improved metadata display and customization in the Planet Imagery Search Panel
  * New ability to save your search to preserve search filters from the Planet Imagery Search Panel
  * Additional search filters
  * Improved Planet Basemap discovery interface and Basemap download tools
  * Ability to determine contributing source scene in a Planet Basemap
  * Ability to set an AOI for high-res tasking in QGIS
  v1.3.3 (2020-12-01)
  * use session with proxy settings to revieve hashid for image preview
  v1.3.2 (2020-11-09)
  * fixed bug where noProxyUrls were set to none, introduced in 1.3.1
  v1.3.1 (2020-10-23)
  * fixed case of noProxyUrls setting being None
  v1.2 (2019-12-06)
  * Added mosaics support
  * Improved support for paginating large daily imagery search result sets
  * Band math for Surface Reflectance basemaps
  v0.1.4 (2019-10-09)
  * Added orders monitor dialog
  * Added optio to retrieve search values when activating a search tab
  v0.1.3 (2019-09-23)
  * Place internal vendoring of packages at beginning of sys.path
  v0.1.2 (2019-09-20)
  * Base implementation, with support for browsing, previewing and ordering
